my first repository
My name is Malaki Joseph Bujiku. I am a Christian serving God as a pastor of a small church in Mwanza City, Tanzania (East Africa). I am married to Ombeni. We have two sons. The first born is Bezaleli (18yrs) and the second boy is Benaya (12yrs). In 2008 God gave me a vision to start a new project called Logos Tanzania. This ministry reaches the community by establishing community schools, health services and vocational skills to youths within the community.
